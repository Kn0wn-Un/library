### Introduction

This is a website to keep track of all the books (read/ unread), just add the book with the title, author and whether you have read it or not.
The book will be added to your list, if unread you can change the status after reading.

### Basic Functions:

1. Adding book by clicking on ***Add new Book button*** with the required fields:
      1. Book Name
      2. Author Name
      3. Number of Pages
      4. Read/Unread status
      
2. Changing Read/Unread status by clicking on the ***tick mark*** (Green Tick = read, Yellow Tick = unread), counter to show how many books have you read out of the total books added.

3. Removing Books by clicking on the ***Remove Book button*** which is there next to the book you want to remove.
